tuftshackming
=============

The second weekly tufts hack. This week's challenge is to make a visualization from a set of tweets.  
You can see this repo in action at [tuftshackming.herokuapp.com][1]  
It is actually a collection of visualizations based on the same set of 3200 tweets.  

 1. A time series of Ming's tweets per day
 2. A visualization of Ming's best friends based on mentions

This project was also an excuse for me to use node and Heroku.  
Enjoy!
